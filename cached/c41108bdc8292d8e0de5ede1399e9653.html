 <div class="wikitext titlehack"><h2>Why V7 Unix matters so much</h2>
 <div class=posttitle style=opacity:0.6><small>November 21, 2021</small></div>
</div>
<div class=wikitext><p>When I talk about things involving the history of Unix, I often
wind up mentioning V7, also known as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_7_Unix>Seventh Edition</a> of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix>Research Unix</a> from Bell Labs (for
a recent example, in <a href=https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/StackSizeLimitWhen>my entry on when Unix got stack size limits</a>). If you're relatively new to the history of
Unix, you might wonder why V7 keeps coming up so often. There are
a number of reasons that V7 matters so much both for the history
of Unix and for what is what we think of as being 'Unix' and the
Unix way.</p>
<p>Unix and C were originally created and developed in the Bell Labs
Computing Sciences Research Center (CSRC) by various well known
people like Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. The CSRC's release of
V7 was a pivotal moment in the history of Unix, as it was both
widely publicized and relatively widely distributed. This led to a
number of effects, both practical and of perceptions.</p>
<p>First, V7 is effectively the common ancestor of various
strains of Unix since then (this is not quite true for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWB/UNIX>PWB</a>, but close enough). Both BSD
Unix and AT&amp;T Unix (System III and System V) branched off from V7, so
things in V7 were generally inherited by both of them, while things
introduced after V7 (in some Unix line) had to make their way back and
forth and didn't always migrate. This tends to be why I go back to V7
(and often no further) to see when something was introduced and if it
was originally common to BSD Unix and System III/System V.</p>
<p>Second, V7 was where a lot of what we think of as the way Unix and
C are was established. V7 is where we got the Bourne shell and a
relatively modern dialect of C, including <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdio>stdio</a>; both the V6 shell and C were
somewhat different, to the point that you couldn't necessarily
compile V6 programs even on 1980s C compilers (never mind modern
ones). In fact a lot of 'Unix' comes from V7, and it's probably the
oldest Research Unix that would feel normal and familiar to us
today as users of modern Unix.</p>
<p>(The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix>Wikipedia page on Research Unix</a> has a useful summary
of what was introduced in what version.)</p>
<p>V7 was also the most widely publicized version of Unix up until
that point and probably for a significant while later. The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System_Technical_Journal>Bell
Labs Technical Journal</a>
published a lot of Unix papers in July and August of 1978, for
example (this was before V7 was released in January 1979, but the
papers were about what was in the process of becoming V7). The V7
documentation was made into a two volume, officially published thing
in the early 1980s that you could buy in bookstores (well, probably
only university and technical bookstores), which made it possible
for people in general to be thoroughly exposed to detailed Unix
things from V7 (and also to C). This spread the ideas and influence
of Unix and C even to people who had never used V7.</p>
<p>(I would like to say that V7 was also widely distributed to
universities (and to some extent to elsewhere), and was thus where
people became exposed to Unix, but in practice I don't think this
was the case. V7 had a relatively narrow time window of only a few
years before it was supplanted in universities by BSD Unix, partly
because BSD ran on the much more powerful and capable DEC Vax.)</p>
<p>A somewhat less pleasant reason to come back to V7 is that it was
the last significant Unix release from the Bell Labs CSRC. To quite
a lot of people, this makes V7 the last 'pure' Unix, the one that
expresses the intentions of the creators of Unix. All other Unixes
(BSD, System V, <a href=https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/LinuxIsAUnix>and Linux</a>) are in some
sense contaminated by outsiders who did not fully get the Unix
philosophy. Both BSD Unix and System III/V added and changed things
which people find objectionable and non-Unixy, so ignoring these
as 'not in V7 and in the original intentions of Unix' is sometimes
seen as convenient (even if, in practice, very few people use Unixes
without these things).</p>
<p>The corollary is that if something was in V7, you can argue that it's
probably pretty close to what the creators of Unix thought it should be
like. This causes people to look at V7 to in some sense see Unix in its
pure form, before it was contaminated by later people and concerns.</p>
<p>PS: Even if V7 didn't last very long at many universities, my
impression is that it often was what got Unix started at them.
People might not have been quite as enthused about buying Vaxes and
using BSD Unix if they hadn't had the experience of V7 before it,
or heard from people who had that experience.</p>
